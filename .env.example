# RAMS Workload Management System - Port Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and modify ports if needed

# PostgreSQL Database Port
# Default: 5432 (standard PostgreSQL port)
# Change if you have another PostgreSQL instance running
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Backend API Port
# Default: 45678 (high port to avoid conflicts)
# Using high port number to prevent conflicts with common development servers
BACKEND_PORT=45678

# Frontend Web UI Port
# Default: 45679 (high port to avoid conflicts)
# Using high port number to prevent conflicts with common development servers
FRONTEND_PORT=45679

# Why high port numbers?
# Ports 3000-4000 are commonly used by Node.js, React, and other development tools.
# Using ports 45678-45679 significantly reduces the chance of port conflicts.

# To use standard ports (3000/3001) instead:
# Uncomment these lines:
# BACKEND_PORT=3000
# FRONTEND_PORT=3001

# After changing ports:
# 1. Save this file as .env
# 2. Run: docker compose down
# 3. Run: docker compose up -d --build
# 4. Access the app at http://localhost:[FRONTEND_PORT]
